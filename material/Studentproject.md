The course CS-E4740 is offered in two variants: a basic variant worth 5 credits and an extended variant which is worth 10 credit. 

The basic variant consists of lectures and corresponding assignments (see  <a href="Assignments.md"> here </a>). 
For the extended variant, students have to complete an **individual student project**. 

The project requires to formulate an application of your choice as an instance of GTVMin and solve it using some 
of the FL algorithms taught in this course. You have to document your project work in the form of a project report.  
You can find a template for the project report here:  <a href="FederatedLearningPaper.pdf"> **pdf** </a>,  <a href="FederatedLearningPaper.tex"> **Latex source** </a>. 
We will organize a peer review during which students review each other's project reports. After this peer review, the 
students must revise your project report according to the reviewer comments. The ultimate deliverable for the student projects is 
the revised project report along with a response letter that explains how the reviewer comments have been taken into account.  

** Submission Deadline for First Version of Project Reports.** TBA 

** Submission Deadline for Peer Reviews.** TBA 

** Submission Deadline for Revised Project Reports.** Whenever you want to finish the course, but no later than 31.07.2024.
