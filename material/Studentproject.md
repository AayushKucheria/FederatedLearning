We offer the course CS-E4740 in two variants: a basic variant **worth five credits** and an extended 
variant **worth ten credits**. The basic variant consists of <a href="Lectures.md"> lectures </a> and 
corresponding <a href="Assignments.md"> assignments </a>. 

The project requires you to formulate an application of your choice as an instance of GTVMin (see Lecture "FL Design Principle") 
and solve it using some of the FL Algorithms taught in this course (e.g., in Lecture "FL Algorithms"). You have to document 
your project work in the form of a project report (report template <a href="FederatedLearningPaper.pdf"> **pdf** </a>,  <a href="FederatedLearningPaper.tex"> **Latex source** </a>). 

We will organize a peer review during which students review each other's project reports. After this peer review, the 
students must revise their project report according to the reviewer's comments. The ultimate deliverable for the 
student projects is the revised report and a response letter (letter template <a href="Response_Letter_Demo.pdf"> **pdf** </a>,  <a href="Response_Letter_Demo.tex"> **Latex source** </a>). This response letter must explain how you used reviewer comments to improve the report. Here are three examples for such a final submission from the previous 
course edition: <a href="FLProject_Sample1.pdf"> **Example 1** </a>, <a href="FLProject_Sample2.pdf"> **Example 2** </a>, <a href="FLProject_Sample3.pdf"> **Example 3** </a>. 

** Submission Deadline for First Version of Project Reports.** TBA 

** Submission Deadline for Peer Reviews.** TBA 

** Submission Deadline for Revised Project Reports.** Whenever you want to finish the course, but no later than 31.07.2024.
